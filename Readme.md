## Tilt Maze

Name: Greg Bekher
Assignment Name: Programming Assignment 1, Part 1 (Tilt Maze)

A. Required Elements
  - User arrow keys or WASD to tilt the board
  - Maneuver the ball to the green circle with the particle generator to win
  - Hit Q or ESC to quit
  - Hit R to restart
  - I allow a maximum tilt of about 22 degrees

B. Additional elements
  - I added wood grain textures to the platform and the walls. See external resources for my sources
  - I changed the emission settings for the particle emitter to make it appear as if it always emits upward
  - I added a bump sound whenever the ball collides with a wall, I figured out how to do this through the Unity audio docs
    * I created the bump sound myself by knocking against my desk and recording it with my phone

C. Known Issues
  - This happens rarely, but sometimes when tilted the right way, the board may be stuck on the horizontal axis until it is tilted in another direction. I think I solved this by changing the rotation constants.

D. External resources
  - I used two wood textures from the following sources:
